with nothing so 'sugar-free' becomes 'sugarfree'.  Setting <code>hyphen = " "</code>

<dd><p>A regex of what characters to keep.  All other 
characters will be removed.  Note that when this is used all text is lower 
case format.  Only adjust this parameter if you really understand how it is 
used.  Note that swapping the <code>\\{p}</code> for <code>[^[:alpha:];:,\']</code> may 
retain more alpha letters but will likely decrease speed.</p></dd>
